Some preprocessing is required before they are ready for consumption by your CNN.\n\nFortunately, I participated in the LUNA16 competition as part of a university course on computer aided diagnosis, so I have some experience working with these files. At this moment we top the leaderboard there :)\n\n**This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive overview of useful steps to take before the data hits your ConvNet/other ML method.**\n\nWhat we will cover:  \n\n* **Loading the DICOM files**, and adding missing metadata  \n* **Converting the pixel values to *Hounsfield Units (HU)***, and what tissue these unit values correspond to\n* **Resampling** to an isomorphic resolution to remove variance in scanner resolution.\n* **3D plotting**, visualization is very useful to see what we are doing.\n* **Lung segmentation**\n* **Normalization** that makes sense.\n* **Zero centering** the scans.\n\n\n---\n\nBefore we start, let's import some packages and determine the available patients."

These files contain a lot of metadata (such as the pixel size, so how long one pixel is in every dimension in the real world). \n\nThis pixel size/coarseness of the scan differs from scan to scan (e.g. the distance between slices may differ), which can hurt performance of CNN approaches. We can deal with this by isomorphic resampling, which we will do later.\n\nBelow is code to load a scan, which consists of multiple slices, which we simply save in a Python list. Every folder in the dataset is one scan (so one patient). One metadata field is missing, the pixel size in the Z direction, which is the slice thickness. Fortunately we can infer this, and we add this to the metadata."

In this case, we will use only connected component analysis.\n\nThe steps:  \n\n* Threshold the image (-320 HU is a good threshold, but it doesn't matter much for this approach)\n* Do connected components, determine label of air around person, fill this with 1s in the binary image\n* Optionally: For every axial slice in the scan, determine the largest solid connected component (the body+air around the person), and set others to 0. This fills the structures in the lungs in the mask.\n* Keep only the largest air pocket (the human body has other pockets of air here and there)."

This expands the mask in all directions. The air + structures in the lung alone will not contain all nodules, in particular it will miss those that are stuck to the side of the lung, where they often appear! So expand the mask a little :)\n\n**This segmentation may fail for some edge cases**. It relies on the fact that the air outside the patient is not connected to the air in the lungs. If the patient has a [tracheostomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy), this will not be the case, I do not know whether this is present in the dataset. Also, particulary noisy images (for instance due to a pacemaker in the image below) this method may also fail. Instead, the second largest air pocket in the body will be segmented. You can recognize this by checking the fraction of image that the mask corresponds to, which will be very small for this case. You can then first apply a morphological closing operation with a kernel a few mm in size to close these holes, after which it should work (or more simply, do not use the mask for this image). \n\n![pacemaker example][1]\n\n# Normalization\nOur values currently range from -1024 to around 2000. Anything above 400 is not interesting to us, as these are simply bones with different radiodensity.  A commonly used set of thresholds in the LUNA16 competition to normalize between are -1000 and 400. Here's some code you can use:\n\n\n  [1]: http://i.imgur.com/po0eX1L.png"

To do this you simply subtract the mean pixel value from all pixels. \n\nTo determine this mean you simply average all images in the whole dataset.  If that sounds like a lot of work, we found this to be around 0.25 in the LUNA16 competition. \n\n**Warning: Do not zero center with the mean per image (like is done in some kernels on here). The CT scanners are calibrated to return accurate HU measurements. There is no such thing as an image with lower contrast or brightness like in normal pictures.**"

You can do all these steps offline (one time and save the result), and I would advise you to do so and let it run overnight as it may take a long time. \n\n**Tip:** To save storage space, don't do normalization and zero centering beforehand, but do this online (during training, just after loading). If you don't do this yet, your image are int16's, which are smaller than float32s and easier to compress as well.\n\n**If this tutorial helped you at all, please upvote it and leave a comment :)**"
